Hi, my name is Hanno. 
I work at Info Support as an IT consultant.
I am both an Oracle ACE and a Java Champion.
I am @hannotify on most social networks - give me a follow.

This talk is about Pijul, a version control system that could perhaps become an alternative to Git.

# Yay,
# Git!

note:
Quick show of hands - who of you is currently using Git?
And who uses a different version control system?

Well, that's understandable!
Because there's a lot to like about Git:

* easy branching
* distributed nature (open-source development, work offline)
* fast

But do we like everything?
Do we like... for example...

* amending commits? (or changing the message)
* committing to the wrong branch and having to fix it?
* running a diff when nothing happens? (`--staged`)
* conflicts when merging or rebasing?
* getting the same conflicts over and over again when we need long-lived branches?
* having to do a fresh clone because the repo is too messed up to repair?
* heated team debates on rebase vs. merge?

Well... not particularly!

note:
Some days it's more like "Dang it, Git!" instead of "Yay, Git!"
There's a website for that, by the way. (slide)

To summarise, I don't always like:

* the documentation 
  * features we often need are buried in some obscure command-line argument
* Git's snapshot-based approach when changes travel
  * rebasing or cherry-picking changes commit identities
  * there's no way to fix a conflict once and for all (`git rerere`)
* Git's many (many!) internal operations that are available to every user, confusing them even more 
* (slide) The Git Manpage Generator illustates this point nicely :-)

But, you know, as long as there isn't something better available, it'll probably be fine, right?

note:

In fact, this is what I always say when teaching people about Git.
This chart is from the Git course I regularly teach at Info Support.
Sure enough, after 2005, nothing seems to have happened in version control world.

In fact, I never even gave it a second thought, until a student asked me about it at the end of a particular course day.
She said: "I like Git well enough, but what is new and cool in version control?"

And because I didn't know the answer to her question, I started researching it and found a newer version control systems.
It was called Pijul.
This talk is about Pijul, and how it's different from Git.
